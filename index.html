			<h2>Playing Texas Hold'em Pokeropoly</h2>
			<span>[Standard Texas Hold'em rules apply]</span>
			<p>
				Begin playing Texas Hold'em.  Players will bet / big blind & little blind with their Monopoly cash.
			</p>
			<h2>Betting Properties</h2>
			<p>
				The most exciting part of Pokeropoly is the ability to wager a Monopoly Property (<b>this includes Railroads and Utilities</b>).				
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Wagering a property</h3>
						<p>
							All players that have <b>not folded</b> must have at least one property in order to be able to wager a property.  
							Only <b>one</b> property betting round per hand is permitted in Texas Hold'em Pokeropoly.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Calling a property wager</h3>
						<p>
							A player may only call property wager by wagering one of their own properties.  Properties have varying values.  
							Therefore; if a player calls another players property wager with a lesser value property, they will need to also wager the cash
							difference between the <b>purchase price</b> of the highest wagered property.  Wagering a property with a greater value is 
							considered as a call and raise.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Wagering / Calling when a property has a houses / hotel</h3>
						<p>
							Houses and hotels can be wagered at their <b>purchase price</b>.  If a property has been wagered, a player with houses / hotel 
							on their properties can use the houses / hotel to call without wagering a property itself.  The player must wager houses / hotel
							until the <b>purchase price</b> of the highest wagered property is met or exceeded.  If the player runs out of houses / hotel they can 
							complete the call with cash. Houses / hotels won in poker hands may be placed on owned properties <b>with / without</b> a Monopoly
							being established. Hotels lost in poker hands played <b>do not</b> restore houses.
						</p>
						<span>[All In: Only <b>one</b> property can be wagered per hand; therefore "all in" means mortgaging all remaining properties]</span>
					</li>
